### Useful information

I'm more of a VueJs guy. Therefore, I took 24 hours to refresh my memory. Pleasantly surprised with the power of the Hooks. It gives React a new dimension. I'm thinking of switching to React ðŸ˜Š
This is my first time using Contentful. I am used to using Strapi. At the moment, I find that Strapi offers more options.

I chose the first project, the "Airbnb Clone"

What I have implemented:
â€¢ All data is searched via requests on Contentful. I have created over 200 listings on contentful using a script that I coded.
â€¢ You can click on the accommodations and you land on a page with the rental details. All the data is grabbed from Contentful.
â€¢ Apartments can be displayed by city. The cities are fetched from Contentful.
â€¢ The design is responsive.
â€¢ The home page is complete (header, navbar, sections, footer).
â€¢ A calendar is displayed when you search by date
